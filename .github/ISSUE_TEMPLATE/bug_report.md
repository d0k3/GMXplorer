** So you want to report a bug? **
Hold on, there are ways you could make things easier for us:
* Give a clear description of the bug (what happened?).
* Give us clear steps to reproduce (when/how did it happen?).
* Give us info about your system (where did it happen?).
* A photograph or even a short video of the bug happening is always helpful!

** Info about your system **
Include this info to make our work easier:
* Console type (O3DS/N3DS)
* Anything special about your console? (defects, custom modifications,...)
* Bootloader (boot9strap/fastboot3ds)
* Did you chainload GodMode9 via Luma?
* Helpful hint: *if you followed the Guide, boot9strap is your bootloader and Luma is your chainloader*

** Help yourself **
* Check your SD card or try a different one (you wouldn't believe how common failing/fake SD cards are, and what kinds of bugs are caused by them).
* Switch to fastboot3DS using [https://github.com/d0k3/OpenFirmInstaller](OpenFirmInstaller).
